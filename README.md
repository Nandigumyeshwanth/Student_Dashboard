# Student_Dashboard
That's an excellent and crucial step for any professional project! A clear README.md makes it easy for anyone (including your future self) to set up and run the dashboard.

Since your project uses a Node.js backend with SQLite and a plain HTML/CSS/JS frontend, the instructions need to cover both environments.

Here is a complete README.md file you can use. Save this content as README.md in the root directory of your project (where the frontend and backend folders are located).

Student Dashboard Application
Project Overview
This is a comprehensive, single-page application (SPA) style dashboard designed for students. It provides a quick overview of enrolled courses, latest progress, and upcoming tasks/reminders.

The application is built with a Node.js/Express backend, a local SQLite database for persistence, and a modern HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript frontend.

Features
Secure Login: Basic username/password authentication (student/password).

Dynamic Data: Fetches course progress and task reminders from the backend API.

Persistent Storage: Data is stored in a local SQLite file (dashboard.db).

User Interface: Modern grid layout with a Hero banner, progress bars, and a profile card.

Personalization: Ability to instantly change the profile photo in the browser.
